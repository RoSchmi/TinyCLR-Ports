# TinyCLR Ports
This repository hosts example ports of TinyCLR OS for different platforms -- along with the TinyCLR OS reference implementation: the FEZ. For information on building a firmware, see https://docs.ghielectronics.com/software/tinyclr/native/intro.html.

The FEZCLR firmware is maintained by GHI Electronics while others are maintained by community contributions.

Keep in mind that building a firmware from source here will not include the additional commercial features that are found in the pre-compiled firmwares we provide for our comercial System on Modules (SoM).
